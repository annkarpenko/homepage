She used to play it back in high school, and ever since she taught me, it has been my passion. I think that for every athlete regarding the sport they play there are certain things that makes their sport special. I fell in love with volleyball the second I got in the court, everything about it makes it amazing.

Every game is a new experience, and every team has different chacteristics were you learn from. There are several reasons why volleyball is my favorite sport, here are my three main reasons of why I love volleyball and I recommend all of you to play it!
